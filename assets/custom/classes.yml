    title: Sated
    text: >
      The Ruinmaw's power increase when they become Sated. Loss actions will sate the Ruinmaw's hunger, denoted with a <emoji>sated symbol at the bottom of the action. Persistent loss actions with a track can have a <emoji>:sated symbol within a use slot. When that space is used or after a non-track loss action is resolved, the Ruinmaw must immediately become sated, which lasts until the end of their next turn.
      While Sated, certain actions have mandatory augmented effects. This augment is represented with a <emoji>:sated , followed by a colon, followed by how the action is augmented
